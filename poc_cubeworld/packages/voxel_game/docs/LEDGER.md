# Architecture Ledger — the voxel kit

> Where rule 17 (`CLAUDE.md`) writes. One entry per structural observation found mid-task
> that was **not** the task. Four mandatory fields: `Lens`, `Evidence` (`file:line`),
> `Cost of leaving it`, `Found while`. An entry is recorded here and **not fixed in the
> commit that found it**. An entry that gets fixed moves to `## Closed` with a fifth field,
> `Closed by`; it is never deleted.
>
> **IDs.** The first three entries were written in the app's ledger
> (`poc_cubeworld/docs/LEDGER.md`), whose IDs are `CL-nnn`, and moved here on 2026-09-22
> with their IDs kept, so every citation of them still finds them by name. **New entries
> here are `KL-nnn`, from `KL-001`**: once this folder is a repository of its own, two
> ledgers handing out the same `CL-` counter would collide the first time both added an
> entry, and a separate prefix is what the app's ledger chose for the same reason.

### CL-005 · The kit's whole top half is exercised only by an example nothing runs

- **Lens:** testing / kit surface
- **Evidence:** `DefaultHud` (108 lines), the kit's `InventoryScreen` (181) and `VoxelGameWidget` (`lib/src/ui/voxel_game_widget.dart:256,260`, which wires both) are reachable from exactly one place: `example/lib/main.dart:4`, a one-line app. `test/` holds three files (`game_test.dart`, `goal_test.dart`, `net_game_test.dart`) and none of them mounts a widget. The app the kit was extracted from never touches them — the app's `lib/src/ui/game_view.dart:128` (in `poc_cubeworld/`) builds its own `InventoryScreen` (352 lines) and its own HUD (809).
- **Cost of leaving it:** the split itself is right (rule 7 — the kit ships a default, the game ships Dawnforge's), but the default has no witness. Rule 18 says a stage is done when it was seen running, and this surface has been seen running once, by whoever last opened the example by hand. A `flutter_scene` upgrade, a shader bundle rebuild or an `InputMap` change can break the kit's only out-of-the-box screen and every test still passes, because the app that would have noticed draws its own.
- **Found while:** 2026-09-21 — answering why `lib/` imports `voxel_game` in only two files.
- **Moved:** 2026-09-22 (`VR3`) from `poc_cubeworld/docs/LEDGER.md`, ID kept. Paths rewritten from this folder; the app's files are named as the app's.

### CL-008 · The decision register still answers questions about packages that no longer exist

- **Lens:** docs / stale SSOT
- **Evidence:** `docs/VOXEL_KIT_PLAN_2026-09-18.md:415` (`VKD1`) records the decision as "**Five packages**, the kit on top" and justifies it with "a game that only wants the world takes `voxel_worldgen` + `voxel_scene`"; `:418` (`VKD4`) says the noise is copied "into `voxel_worldgen`". `VC1` (`8a2b9853`) folded `voxel_worldgen` and four others into `voxel_engine` and `VC2` (`e349d46e`) renamed `voxel_audio`, so both decisions cite packages that were deleted two days later. `docs/VOXEL_CONSOLIDATION_PLAN_2026-09-19.md` records the new answer but does not mark the old one superseded, and `VKD1` is the entry a reader reaches first, since it is the register's first row.
- **Cost of leaving it:** a decision register is consulted precisely when somebody is about to re-litigate a settled question — `CLAUDE.md` rule 4 (the app's and this folder's) ("a new package earns its place by an optional heavy dependency, never by being a different subject") is the *current* answer and it contradicts `VKD1` as written. The failure mode is a future session splitting a subject back out on the authority of the register, which is doing exactly what it was built to prevent.
- **Found while:** 2026-09-21 — answering why `lib/` imports `voxel_game` in only two files.
- **Moved:** 2026-09-22 (`VR3`) from `poc_cubeworld/docs/LEDGER.md`, ID kept. Paths rewritten from this folder; the app's files are named as the app's.

### CL-009 · The kit reads a finger and draws no thumb

- **Lens:** kit API / rule 13
- **Evidence:** `CL-003` moved the gesture half of the touch scheme into `InputMap` — a finger on the world mines, uses and looks, and `touchMove` / `setTouchHeld` / `touchDigit` accept an on-screen stick, button and slot. Nothing in the kit calls those three. `lib/src/ui/default_hud.dart` (108 lines) is a `CustomPainter`'s worth of bars and a hotbar, and `voxel_game_widget.dart:249-259` stacks exactly three children over the world — the HUD inside an `IgnorePointer`, and the inventory screen. The controls that do call them are the app's: its `lib/src/ui/touch_controls.dart` (368 lines, in `poc_cubeworld/`), and they are positioned against the app's own HUD geometry (`:86` and `:142` both measure `Hud.hotbarSlotRect`, the app's `lib/src/ui/hud.dart:56`), which is why they did not rise with the rest.
- **Cost of leaving it:** the half that rose is the half that is hard — the tap-versus-hold-versus-drag rule, tuned against a real device once. The half left behind is the visible one, so the kit now *reads* a phone without *looking* like it can be played on one: a game built on `voxel_game` gets mining and looking from a finger and no way to walk, jump or open its bag. The gap is also the wrong shape for a first-time reader, who will conclude touch is unfinished rather than half-delegated. Closing it means the kit's HUD has to publish its hotbar geometry (the one thing the app's layer needs), which is the same conversation as `CL-005` — the kit's default HUD is witnessed by nothing but an example — so the two should be answered together, and by a layout the kit owns rather than a copy of Dawnforge's.
- **Found while:** 2026-09-21 — closing `CL-003`, checking what did *not* rise with the input map.
- **Moved:** 2026-09-22 (`VR3`) from `poc_cubeworld/docs/LEDGER.md`, ID kept. Paths rewritten from this folder; the app's files are named as the app's.
