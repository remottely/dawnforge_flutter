# Architecture Ledger

> Where rule 27 writes. One entry per structural observation found mid-task that was
> **not** the task. Four mandatory fields: `Lens`, `Evidence` (`file:line` + version),
> `Cost of leaving it`, `Found while`. IDs are sequential (`L-001`, `L-002`, …) and
> **never reused** — plans and `PENDING.md` cite entries by ID, so a collision is
> ambiguous forever. `python3 scripts/project/check_ledger_ids_are_unique.py --next`
> hands out the next free one; the commit hook refuses a ledger with a duplicate.
>
> Same mechanism as the Godot repo (`docs/ARCHITECTURE_EVOLUTION.md` there owns the
> full loop; this repo inherits it via the study, §6).
